          From learing to write the first html code, to creating complex react
          and django e-commerce projects, I have always been keen to always
          learn new languages. My skills lie in designing a unique and visually
          aesthetic project and applying the right applications, to achieve the
          perfect user experience.Whilst having Front-End and Back-End skills, I
          focus more on Front End. Since 2021 my focus has been mainly on React
          Libraries.
